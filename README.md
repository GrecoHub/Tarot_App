USER STORY
As a user of Greco Tarot, I am able to click on a pile of cards which reveal 3 random tarot cards. Further insight can be revealed about each tarot card by hovering over the card.

APPEARANCE
There is picture of a pile of tarot cards centered at the top of the screen.
Underneath the pile, there are 2 divs:
    div 1) Three images of the back of cards are laid out in a row depicting cards that are face down.
    div 2) in the same row as div 1, there is a list of directions for how to use the app.

Directions:
First: Click on the pile of cards at the top of the screen.
Next: Hover over each card to find out more!

Actions:
After clicking on the pile of cards, I now see that the 3 "face-down" images have been replaced by 3 random "face-up" tarot cards.
as I hover my mouse over each tarot card, the div that had dirctions listed now has a description of the card.
